        <h1>What is eSports?</h1>
  <p>
    eSports, short for electronic sports, is a form of organized video game competition played between individuals or teams.
    Games like <strong>Call of Duty</strong>, <strong>Dota 2</strong>, <strong>League of Legends</strong>, and <strong>Free Fire</strong> 
    are some of the most popular in the eSports scene. These events attract large audiences online and even in physical arenas, much like traditional sports.
    Professional players can earn money through sponsorships, streaming, and tournament prize pools. 
    eSports is especially popular among young people and is growing into a billion-dollar global industry.
    It also offers career paths in coaching, commentary, content creation, and event management.
